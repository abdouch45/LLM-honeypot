# Migration Plan: Archived Files Feature

This document describes the migration steps for the log archival feature, which allows safe deletion of old rotated log files while preserving their processed statistics.

## Overview

**Goal**: Enable permanent archival of rotated Cowrie log files (`cowrie.json-*`).

**Key Changes**:
- New `archived_files.json` tracks filename → hash mappings for archived logs
- Cache entries for archived files are never pruned
- Statistics from archived files are always included in the final merged state

## Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup current cache file
- [ ] Verify Docker containers are running
- [ ] Confirm logs volume is mounted correctly

---

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current State

```bash
# Create backup directory
BACKUP_DIR=$(echo honeypot-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d))
mkdir -p ~/$BACKUP_DIR

# Backup the cache file
docker compose run --rm web cp /data/stats/honeypot_cache.json /data/stats/honeypot_cache.json.backup

# Copy backup to host 
cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/llm-honeypot_stats_data/_data/honeypot_cache.json.backup ~/$BACKUP_DIR/
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Code

```bash
# Pull latest changes (if applicable)
git pull

# Rebuild the web container with new code
docker compose build web
```

### Step 3: Run Migration in Preview Mode

```bash
# Run migration with --pre flag (writes to pre_archived_files.json, app ignores it)
docker compose run --rm web python migrate_archived.py --pre
```

**Expected output**:
```
=== PREVIEW MODE (writing to pre_archived_files.json, app ignores this) ===

Loaded cache with N hashes
✓ Matched: cowrie.json-2025-01-15 → abc123def456...
✓ Matched: cowrie.json-2025-01-16 → 789xyz012abc...
? Orphaned: deadbeef1234... → kept as UNKNOWN_deadbeef

=== Migration Summary ===
Matched to files: X
Orphaned (kept):  Y
Total archived:   Z

Output written to: /data/stats/pre_archived_files.json

To apply for real: python migrate_archived.py
```

### Step 4: Inspect Preview Output

```bash
# View the preview file
docker compose run --rm web cat /data/stats/pre_archived_files.json | python -m json.tool

# Count rotated log files
docker compose run --rm web sh -c 'ls /data/cowrie/logs/cowrie.json-* 2>/dev/null | wc -l'
```

**Verify**:
- All existing rotated files are matched
- Orphaned hashes (if any) are preserved with `UNKNOWN_` prefix
- Total count seems reasonable

### Step 5: Apply Migration

```bash
# Run migration for real (creates archived_files.json)
docker compose run --rm web python migrate_archived.py
```
docker compose run --rm web echo "Migration helper removed. Implement migration in Node or restore script."
### Step 6: Verify Migration Success

```bash
# Check archived_files.json exists
docker compose run --rm web ls -la /data/stats/archived_files.json

# Restart web service to pick up changes
docker compose restart web

# Check logs for archive-related messages
docker compose logs web | grep -i archiv
```

**Expected log messages**:
```
INFO - Total archived files: X, archived hashes: Y
Output written to: /data/stats/pre_archived_files.json
To apply for real: the Python migration script has been removed. Implement a Node migration or restore the Python script.

### Step 7: Cleanup Preview File

```bash
docker compose run --rm web rm /data/stats/pre_archived_files.json
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong, follow these steps to restore the previous state.

### Rollback Option 1: Remove Archived Files Feature

```bash
# Remove the archived_files.json (app will work without it - backwards compatible)
docker compose run --rm web rm /data/stats/archived_files.json

# Restart web service
docker compose restart web
docker compose run --rm web echo "Migration helper removed. Implement migration in Node or restore script."

The code is backwards compatible — if `archived_files.json` doesn't exist, `load_archived_files()` returns an empty dict and the system behaves like before.

### Rollback Option 2: Restore Cache Backup

If cache was corrupted:

```bash
# Restore cache from backup
docker compose run --rm web cp /data/stats/honeypot_cache.json.backup /data/stats/honeypot_cache.json

# Remove archived_files.json
docker compose run --rm web rm -f /data/stats/archived_files.json

# Restart web service
docker compose restart web
```

### Rollback Option 3: Full Code Rollback

If new code is causing issues:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose build web
docker compose up -d web

# Remove migration artifacts
docker compose run --rm web rm -f /data/stats/archived_files.json
docker compose run --rm web rm -f /data/stats/pre_archived_files.json
```

## Post-Migration 

### Archiving Old Logs

Once migration is complete, you can safely delete old rotated log files

### Backup Cache Files

Use the backup script to upload cache files to Backblaze B2:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID="your-key-id"
export B2_APPLICATION_KEY="your-key"
export B2_BUCKET_ID="your-bucket-id"

# Run backup
./scripts/backup_honeypot.sh
```

For automated daily backups, add to crontab:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (daily at 3 AM)
0 3 * * * B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=xxx B2_APPLICATION_KEY=xxx B2_BUCKET_ID=xxx /path/to/llm-honeypot/scripts/backup_honeypot.sh >> /var/log/honeypot-backup.log 2>&1
```
